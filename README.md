An RPG game where you play as the wizard and battle against 3 monsters each tough than the other. 

Used many Next-level Javascript features like:
1. Array.reduce()
2. Ternary operator (Finally! i'll mostly be using these now instead of the if-else statements)
3. Anonymous functions are my new get go. Arrow functions condense the code so much and code readability is improved.

Learned js classes. I didn't mind using constructor functions but I knew I'll be dealing with classes in teh future anyway with reactjs so I might as well learn about it already. It wasn't as hard as I was told by my friends to be honest.

Scope, this and closures was a big revelation for me. Learning about that made writing code much easier!
